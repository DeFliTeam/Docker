The "dump978" container receives 978MHz UAT signals from your DeFli Receiver, and demodulates ADS-B UAT messages, making them available for all other containers.

Open the docker-compose.yml file that was created when deploying readsb.

Append the following lines to the end of the file (inside the services: section):

  dump978:
    image: INSERT DEFLI IMAGE PATH
    tty: true
    container_name: dump978
    restart: always
    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
    environment:
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
      - LAT=${FEEDER_LAT}
      - LON=${FEEDER_LONG}
      - DUMP978_deflirec_DEVICE=978
    tmpfs:
      - /run/readsb
      - /run/uat2json 
      
      Update readsb container configuration
      
      Before running docker compose, we also want to update the configuration of the readsb container, so that it pulls the demodulated UAT data from the dump978 container.
      
      Open the docker-compose.yml and add the following environment variable to the readsb service:
      
            - READSB_NET_CONNECTOR=dump978,37981,raw_in
            
     So, if your readsb service has not been modified from the previous step, it should look now look like this:
     
     version: '3.8'

volumes:
  readsbpb_rrd:
  readsbpb_autogain:

services:
  readsb:
    image: PATH TO protobuf DeFli IMAGE
    tty: true
    container_name: readsb
    hostname: readsb
    restart: always
    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
      - READSB_DEVICE_TYPE=deflirec
      - READSB_DEFLIREC_DEVICE=UUID
      - READSB_GAIN=autogain
      - READSB_LAT=${FEEDER_LAT}
      - READSB_LON=${FEEDER_LONG}
      - READSB_RX_LOCATION_ACCURACY=2
      - READSB_STATS_RANGE=true
      - READSB_NET_ENABLE=true
      - READSB_NET_CONNECTOR=dump978,37981,raw_in
    volumes:
      - readsbpb_rrd:/run/collectd
      - readsbpb_autogain:/run/autogain
    tmpfs:
      - /run/readsb
      
      At this point, you can issue the command docker compose up -d to refresh both the readsb and dump978 containers.
      
      To see the data being received and decoded by our new container, run the command docker exec -it readsb viewadsb. This should display a real-time departure-lounge-style screen showing all the aircraft being tracked. Look for entries in the Mode column listed as ADS-R/UAT.
