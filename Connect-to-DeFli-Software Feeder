Open the docker-compose.yml file that was created when deploying readsb. 

Append the following lines to the end of the file (inside the services: section). Please edit the following parameters: 

READSB_NET_CONNECTOR 

remove dump978,37981,raw_in; if you don't have are not in the USA 

Add the DeFli feed in the format feed.defli.org,30004,beast_reduce_plus_out; 

UUID - enter your UUID here -- obtained from registration on DeFli explorer 

MLAT_CONFIG add the DeFli Feed- feed.defli.org,31090,39000;feed.defli.org,64006,39001;

The FEEDER_LAT, FEEDER_LONG, and FEEDER_ALT_M variables should already exist in your .env file, but if they don't feel free to replace these values with your station's Latitude, Longitude (in decimal degrees), and Altitude above the ground (in (whole) meters)
 
The file now should now look like this: 

  multifeeder:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-multifeeder
    tty: true
    container_name: multifeeder
    hostname: multifeeder
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
      - READSB_NET_CONNECTOR=readsb,30005,beast_in;dump978,37981,raw_in;feed.adsb.fi,31090,39000;feed.adsb.one,64006,39001;
      - UUID=YOUR UUID
      - MLAT_CONFIG=feed.defli.org,31090,39000;feed.defli.org,64006,39001;
      - READSB_LAT=${FEEDER_LAT}
      - READSB_LON=${FEEDER_LONG}
      - READSB_ALT=${FEEDER_ALT_M}m
    
    
    tmpfs:
      - /run/readsb
      - /var/log



Once the file has been updated, issue the command docker compose pull && docker compose up -d in the application directory to apply the changes and bring up the multifeeder container. You should see the following output:

readsb is up-to-date
defli is up-to-date
Creating multifeeder...
