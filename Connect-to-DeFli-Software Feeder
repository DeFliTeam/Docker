Update .env file with feeder-id

Inside your application directory (/opt/adsb), edit the .env file using your favourite text editor. Beginners may find the editor nano easy to use:

nano /opt/adsb/.env

This file holds all of the commonly used variables (such as our latitude, longitude and altitude). We're going to add our DeFli feeder-id to this file. Add the following line to the file:

DEFLI_FEEDER_ID=YOURFEEDERID

Replace YOURFEEDERID with the feeder-id that was generated on the Defli Explorer UUID Creation http://defli-wallet.bubbleapps.io/

DeFli_FEEDER_ID=acbf1f88-09a4-3a47-a4a0-10ae138d0c1g 

# Deploying DeFli Software 

Open the docker-compose.yml file that was created when deploying readsb.

Append the following lines to the end of the file (inside the services: section):

  defli:
    image: PATH TO DEFLI IMAGE
    tty: true
    container_name: defli
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - readsb
    ports:
      - 8081:8080
    environment:
      - BEASTHOST=readsb
      - LAT=${FEEDER_LAT}
      - LONG=${FEEDER_LONG}
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
      - FEEDER_ID=${Defli_FEEDER_ID}
    tmpfs:
      - /run:exec,size=64M
      - /var/log
      
  If you are in the USA and are also running the dump978 container with a second SDR, add the following additional lines to the environment: section:
  
        - UAT_RECEIVER_TYPE=relay
      - UAT_RECEIVER_HOST=dump978
      
   Once the file has been updated, issue the command docker compose up -d in the application directory to apply the changes and bring up the defli container. You should see the following output:
   
   readsb is up-to-date
adsbx is up-to-date
Creating defli 

Once running visit the DeFli explorer and update your location and height (altitude) using the same figures in the .env file

Remember, if you change your location and altitude, you'll need to update your .env file locally (and re-run docker compose up -d from your application directory)!
