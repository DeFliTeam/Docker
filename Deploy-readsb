# Deploy "readsb"

The "readsb" container is the heart of our "adsb" application. It receives 1090MHz ADS-B ES RF signals from your DeFli Receiver, and demodulates ADS-B messages, making them available for all other containers.

In your favourite text editor, create a file named docker-compose.yml in your application directory (/opt/adsb) if following along verbatim.

nano docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'

volumes:
  readsbpb_rrd:
  readsbpb_autogain:

    container_name: readsb
    hostname: readsb

    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
      - READSB_DEVICE_TYPE=deflirec
      - READSB_deflirec_DEVICE=UUID
      - READSB_GAIN=autogain
      - READSB_LAT=${FEEDER_LAT}
      - READSB_LON=${FEEDER_LONG}
      - READSB_RX_LOCATION_ACCURACY=2
      - READSB_STATS_RANGE=true
      - READSB_NET_ENABLE=true
    volumes:
      - readsbpb_rrd:/run/collectd
      - readsbpb_autogain:/run/autogain
    tmpfs:
      - /run/readsb
      - /var/log
      
      The above wiil: 
      
      Create two docker volumes, readsbpb_rrd and readsb_autogain, which are used to store the RRD files and autogain state files respectively.
      Create a service named readsb that will run the the DeFli protobuf container 
      We're presenting the USB bus through to this container (so readsb can talk to the USB-attached DeFli Receiver 
      We're mapping TCP port 8080 through to the container so we can access the web interface
      The variable READSB_deflirec_DEVICE tells readsb to look for an DeFli receiver device with the UUID assigned by the mfr 
      We're passing several environment variables through, including our timezone, latitude and longitude from the .env file (denoted by ${VARIABLE}).
      We're using tmpfs for volumes that have regular I/O. Any files stored in a tmpfs mount are temporarily stored outside the container's writable layer. This helps to reduce
      The size of the container, by not writing changes to the underlying container; and
      SD Card or SSD wear
      
      Once this file is created, issue the command docker compose up -d to bring up the environment.
      
      docker compose up -d
      
      You should see the following output:
      
      Creating network "adsb_default" with the default driver
Creating readsb         ... done

# Viewing Live Data 

To verify the container is working correctly you can use the following command to bring up live data

docker exec -it readsb viewadsb

You should also be able to point your web browser at http://docker.host.ip.addr:8080/ to view the web interface (change docker.host.ip.addr to the IP address of your docker host). You should see a map showing your currently tracked aircraft, and a link to the "Performance Graphs".
