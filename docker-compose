Step 1: Run this command to install docker and docker compose, install your RTLSDR and blacklist drivers. 

bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-install/main/docker-install.sh)

Step 2: Create a new directory by running command sudo mkdir deflidocker. Enter this directory using command cd /home/deflidocker

Step 3: Whilst in this directory create a new file with command sudo nano docker-compose-readsb.yml  
You will be presented with a blank file. Copy the following text and paste it in to the file. You will need to change your latitude, longitude and timezone. Once you have done this, save the file by pressing ctl + x and entering “y” when promoted about saving the file.

version: '2.0'

volumes:

  readsbpb_rrd:

  readsbpb_autogain:

services:

  readsb:

    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf:latest

    tty: true

    container_name: readsb

    hostname: readsb

    restart: always

    devices:

      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb

    ports:

      - 8080:8080

      - 30005:30005

    environment:

      - TZ=Australia/Perth

      - READSB_DCFILTER=true

      - READSB_DEVICE_TYPE=rtlsdr

      - READSB_FIX=true

      - READSB_GAIN=autogain

      - READSB_LAT=-33.33333

      - READSB_LON=111.11111

      - READSB_MODEAC=true

      - READSB_RX_LOCATION_ACCURACY=2

      - READSB_STATS_RANGE=true

      - READSB_NET_ENABLE=true

    volumes:

      - readsbpb_rrd:/run/collectd

      - readsbpb_autogain:/run/autogain

      - /proc/diskstats:/proc/diskstats:ro

    tmpfs:

      - /run/readsb:size=64M

      - /var/log:size=32M

Step 4: As you did with step 3, you are going to a new file. Ensure you are still inside the “deflidocker” directory and run command sudo nano docker-compose-tar1090.yml 

Again you will be presented with a blank file. Copy the text from below and paste it in to the file. You will need to again change the variables for latitude, longitude and timezone. Once you have done this you can press ctrl + x to exit and then “y” to save. 

version: '3.8'

services:

  tar1090:

    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-tar1090:latest

    tty: true

    container_name: tar1090

    restart: always

    environment:

      - TZ=Australia/Perth

      - BEASTHOST=readsb

      - MLATHOST=adsbx

      - LAT=-33.33333

      - LONG=111.11111

    volumes:

      - /opt/adsb/tar1090/globe_history:/var/globe_history

      - /opt/adsb/tar1090/timelapse1090:/var/timelapse1090

      - /opt/adsb/tar1090/graphs1090:/var/lib/collectd

      - /proc/diskstats:/proc/diskstats:ro

    # - /run/airspy_adsb:/run/airspy_adsb

    ports:

      - 8078:80

    tmpfs:

      - /run:exec,size=64M

      - /var/log

Step 5: Run the following command to start your docker-compose services   docker compose -f docker-compose-readsb.yml up -d

You should now be able to browse to:

    http://dockerhost:8078/ to access the tar1090 web interface.

    http://dockerhost:8078/?replay to see a replay of past data

    http://dockerhost:8078/?heatmap to see the heatmap for the past 24 hours.

    http://dockerhost:8078/?heatmap&realHeat to see a different heatmap for the past 24 hours.

    http://dockerhost:8078/graphs1090/ to see performance graphs
