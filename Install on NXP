# Installaing DeFli on NXP Boards Including Milesight and MatchX M2 Pro. 

Ensure your laptop or computer has internet connection and the device is turned on. 
The device should be available for connection using the SSID in the format of "MatchX_BOX_xxxx"
The default password is "matchxiot" 

After connected, users can use ssh with terminal or putty in Windows to login 192.168.8.1, the default password is root.
If you are using Ethernet or WiFi you can replace the IP address with your own assigned to the device. 

Your command line should now read "root@OpenWrt".

# Run Install Script 

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeFliTeam/Docker/main/install.sh) 

# Application Environment

# Create a directory to host our project 

We need a directory to host our application. The name of this directory will be the name of our application. Accordingly, we prefer to use /opt/adsb, so our application is called "adsb":

sudo mkdir -p /opt/adsb 
cd /opt/adsb

You will likely also want to change the ownership of this directory to your regular user account, so you don't have to use sudo to edit the files within. To do this:
sudo chown $(id -u) /opt/adsb

# Create a .env file to hold our environment's variables 

Inside this directory, create a file named .env using your favourite text editor. Beginners may find the editor nano easy to use:

nano /opt/adsb/.env

This file will hold all of the commonly used variables (such as our latitude, longitude and altitude). Initially, add the contents of the file as follows (replacing the values enclosed in <> with values for your environment:

FEEDER_ALT_FT=<your antenna's altitude in feet>
FEEDER_ALT_M=<your antenna's altitude in metres>
FEEDER_LAT=<your latitude>
FEEDER_LONG=<your longitude>
FEEDER_TZ=<your timezone>

...where:

FEEDER_ALT_FT is set your your antenna's height in feet above mean seal level 
FEEDER_ALT_M is set to your antenna's height in metres above mean sea level 
FEEDER_LAT is set to your antenna's latitude
FEEDER_LONG is set to your antenna's longitude
FEEDER_TZ is set to your timezone 

For example

FEEDER_ALT_FT=103.3465
FEEDER_ALT_M=31.5
FEEDER_LAT=-31.9505
FEEDER_LONG=115.8605
FEEDER_TZ=Australia/Perth
